        <h2>Beginners guide</h2>
        <p>Discover the basics of bouldering: techniques, equipment, and tips to start safely.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>What is bouldering?</b></li>
            Let’s start with the basics. Bouldering is a type of climbing performed on shorter walls, typically no taller than 4.5 meters (15 feet). It can be practiced outdoors on natural rock formations, such as those found in Fontainebleau, or indoors on artificial walls equipped with colored holds that define different routes based on difficulty levels. Indoors, safety is ensured by thick mats that cushion falls.  
            <br/>
            In urban areas, indoor bouldering has gained remarkable popularity in recent years. Accessible to everyone regardless of age or fitness level, this activity combines sport and fun in a safe environment, making it perfect for beginners and seasoned climbers alike.  
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <li><b>What equipment do you need to get started?</b></li>
            One of the great advantages of bouldering is that it requires very little equipment! Unlike other forms of climbing, there’s no need for a harness, helmet, or ropes. This makes it a stress-free and cost-effective activity for beginners.  
            <br/>
            The only essential item is a pair of climbing shoes. If you don’t have your own, don’t worry—they can usually be rented for a small fee at the climbing gym. Your shoes should fit snugly to ensure good grip on the holds, but they shouldn’t cause discomfort, especially if you’re just starting out. If the size doesn’t feel right, ask to exchange them. 
            <br/>
            For the rest of your outfit, prioritize simplicity and comfort :
            <ul>
                <li>Bottoms : Leggings, jogging pants, shorts, or stretchy trousers work best..</li>
                <li>Top : A fitted or loose T-shirt, depending on your preference. .</li>
                <li>Avoid climbing shirtless, and opt for lightweight, flexible clothes that can protect you from potential scrapes on rough surfaces.</li>
            </ul>
            In short, wear something that allows free movement and can handle a little wear and tear!        
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <li><b>How to climb</b></li>
            Bouldering is a fun activity with clear rules that ensure both safety and enjoyment. Follow these steps:                
            <ol>
                <li>Starting to climb</li>
                Place your hands and feet on the holds marked with tape that matches the color of your chosen problem. For example, on an orange problem, two pieces of tape will indicate the hand holds, and two will mark the foot holds.<br/>
                If a hold doesn’t have tape, it means you can rest your hands or feet directly on the wall or keep them free. 
                <li>Progressing through the climbing</li>
                During your climb, use only the holds matching the color of your chosen problem. You can also use the gray or wooden volumes attached to the wall. Be careful to avoid forbidden zones, which are clearly marked with black tape.                
                <li>Safely climbing down</li> 
                To climb down, use any available holds, regardless of color, as well as the gray handles. Descend as low as possible before dropping, and always check that no one is underneath you.                  
                Learning how to fall properly is essential for safe climbing. Avoid trying to catch yourself with your hands or arms. Aim to land on your feet and then roll backward onto your hips to distribute the impact.<br/>
                </ol>
                With these guidelines in mind, you can fully enjoy every bouldering session while minimizing risks. Happy climbing! <br/>
                <br/>
                <li><b>Warming up before climbing</b></li>
                Warming up is a crucial step before starting any climbing session. It prepares your body, reduces the risk of injury, and enhances your performance.<br/>
                Here’s how to warm up effectively for a climbing session:  
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Mobilize your joints</b>
                        <br/>
                        Perform circular motions or arm swings to warm up the joints that will be most engaged: fingers, wrists, shoulders, arms, hips, knees, feet, and ankles.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Activate your body</b>
                        <br/>
                        Gently warm up your muscles with dynamic exercises, such as squatting to activate your legs, doing high knees to improve mobility, and doing light push-ups to stimulate your arms and shoulders. 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Start with easy route</b>
                        <br/>
                        Ease into your session by climbing easy problems, often called warm-up routes. These simpler climbs help increase your body temperature, prepare your muscles for more intense movements and reduce the risk of injuries like strains or tendinitis.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Don’t forget your fingers !</b>
                        <br/>
                        As fingers are heavily used in climbing, include specific exercises, such as light squeezes on a soft ball or stretches for your flexor and extensor tendons.  
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Adapt your warm-up to your planned intensity</b>
                        <br/>
                        If you plan to tackle challenging or technical problems, spend more time warming up. A full warm-up should take about 10–15 minutes.
                        <br/>
                        Once properly warmed up, you’ll be ready to climb with energy, fluidity, and reduced risk of injury.
                    </li>
                </ul>
