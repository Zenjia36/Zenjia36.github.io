    <ul>
        <li><b>What equipment is required?</b> 
        Climbing shoes and a harness if you want to climb a route, but you can usually rent both from the gym if you don't have your own. Otherwise, comfortable clothing and water to stay hydrated.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>Is bouldering dangerous?</b> 
        Not if you respect security rules.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>Is there a minimum age?</b> 
        Most gyms accept children aged 6 and over.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>How much does bouldering cost?</b> 
        The cost of climbing can vary according to several factors, including the type of climbing (bouldering, route, outdoor), location, and whether you choose a climbing gym or natural sites.<br/> 
        For occasional beginners: expect to pay between €15 and €30 per session (including admission and equipment hire).
        <br/> 
        For regular practice: around €500 to €1,000 per year, including subscription and purchase of basic equipment.
        <br/>
        If you're a beginner, it's often a good idea to start with rental equipment before investing in your own.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>What are the benefits of climbing?</b> 
        Climbing is a complete discipline that combines sport, reflection and self-improvement. It's an ideal activity for anyone looking to improve their physical condition while cultivating a strong mental outlook. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, every session is an opportunity to progress both physically and mentally!</li>
        <br/>
        <li><b>What are the difficulty levels?</b> 
        Bouldering, practiced on shorter structures without ropes, has its own rating systems. The French system uses the following dues:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Ratings: 1 to 9, often subdivided (e.g. 6A, 6A+, 6B).</li>
            <li>More accessible than the route ratings, but the technical difficulty of the movements is accentuated.</li>
            <li>Example :</li>
            <li>1 to 3: Very easy, ideal for beginners.</li>
            <li>4 to 5: Intermediate, requires good basic technique.</li>
            <li>6A to 7C: Advanced, requiring strength and precision.</li>
            <li>8A and up: Expert, complex and very physical movements. </li>
            <li>The level of difficulty is often represented by a color code on the holds. This depends on the climbing gym.</li>
        </ul>
