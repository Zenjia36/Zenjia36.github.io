        Created in 1990 on the initiative of three PE teachers from the Institut National des Jeunes Sourds, this climbing gym, affiliated to the Fédération Française de la Montagne et de l'Escalade (FFME), came into being thanks to the provision of a wall in the school's gymnasium. From its modest beginnings, the artificial climbing structure (SAE) has grown to reach a height of 10 metres and a width of 45 metres.
        A second hall has been added, offering a wide variety of areas such as slabs, dihedrals, a roof, as well as a Güllich pan and other modern equipment. Escalad'Indoor doesn't limit itself to indoor climbing: the club organizes outdoor outings to discover natural sites, and offers educational resources such as training sheets and specialized books. All of this in a friendly atmosphere where the transmission of knowledge and the pleasure of climbing are at the heart of our priorities.
